# Autonomous-uv-disinfection-robot
s we face a worldwide healthcare crisis caused by COVID-19, there's a large need for disinfection. This tutorial can be followed by anyone who is new to ROS all the instructions are mentioned so that you too can build an autonomous UV bot.UV-C  in many parts of the globe for fighting the COVID-19. Currently, such units are either stationary or moved by humans. We improved upon that concept and built an autonomous, mobile unit that may move around lobbies and hallways get into rooms to kill the bulk of the bacteria and viruses.
